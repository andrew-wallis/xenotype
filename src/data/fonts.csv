The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files spanning 9 different visual styles (Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and Unicase) and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.) Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts. For an illustrated presentation and description of the family, please visit its Bēhance page.
While this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.
He is grateful to the creative souls on the Typophile, TypeDrawers and Typografie forums, and Github, for a wealth of knowledge about type design, and for providing a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant during its development. He also thanks the tireless folks at Glyphs, in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer of Schriftlabor and Georg Seifert. Special thanks go to Dave Crossland and Google Fonts for making the libre release of this font family possible through generous funding of the development process.
The Cormorant project is led by Christian Thalmann, a type designer based in Zurich, Switzerland. To contribute, see github.com/CatharsisFonts/Cormorant

Its design was inspired by an original printed sample of a French Transitional typeface which follows the Romain Du Roi typeface introduced in 1702.
As a transitional type, it is marked by an interest in rational planning and it has a tension between rigor and expression. It feels generally formal and rational but its rounded terminals make it more contemporary and friendly. It also offers an occasional flourish, especially in the italics.
The June 2022 update offers an major language support update.
In March 2024, the glyph set for GF Africa Pri has been enhanced with improved diacritics, along with the addition of some other basic language support from the 'Beyond' glyph set. Updates were also made to currency symbols, other symbols, spaces, and NSM localization.

Initially they were designed with dyslexia and struggling readers in mind, but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend project, soon found out that these fonts are also great for everyone else.
The first set of Lexend fonts by Thomas Jockin ( Deca, Exa, Giga, Mega, Peta, Tera, Zetta) becomes wider and more openly spaced (also known as ""tracked out""). This new version of Lexend is a variable font with a weight axis.
Please note that the initial release of this font had a lighter Regular weight. It has been decided for the update of July 2021 to align the Regular weight with the one of Lexend Deca which is slightly bolder. Lexend and Lexend Deca are therefore the same (for now…). Ultimately this version will offer a HyperExpansion axis which will allow variation of inner and outer space of letterforms.
True to Bonnie’s vision, Lexend fonts are freely available for all since 2019 in Google Fonts.

The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types that make the city look so beautiful.

Unica® was an attempt to create the ultimate sans-serif – a hybrid of Helvetica, Univers and Akzidenz Grotesk. Designed by Team ’77 and released to great acclaim in 1980, Unica went missing under a heap of legal disputes and has never been available as a full, digital typeface. Until now. Unica’s story starts in the 1970s. Electronic, on-screen phototypesetting was gaining popularity, but most sans-serif typefaces on the market had been designed earlier, in the era of metal type. The revered Haas Type Foundry in Münchenstein, Switzerland, saw the chance to develop a new sans-serif face that was optimized for the new technology and filled the gap in the market. To develop their new product, they turned to Swiss type design trio, Team ’77 (André Gürtler, Christian Mengelt and Erich Gschwind).
Team ’77 set out to design a font based on Helvetica but drawing on other sans-serif typefaces, principally Univers. The name they gave it would also be a hybrid of the two.
They went about the task with forensic rigour. Working from prints of Helvetica, Univers and Akzidenz Grotesk, the trio identified, compared and evaluated the finest of details, creating a new-generation sans-serif that eliminated the imperfections of its predecessors. “Unica was designed to be different,” said André Gürtler; “sharper than Helvetica, warmer than Univers, cleaner than Akzidenz.”
Released in 1980, Unica hit the sweet spot. It was clean, understated and elegant. But it found only limited success. Desktop publishing software rendered phototypesetting obsolete. Unica became entangled in a dispute over ownership and disappeared from the market. The typographic love-child became the lost child.
Lost no more. For 2015, Monotype’s Toshi Omagari has given this classic a fresh, digital lease of life, with a full set of weights, an extended range of glyphs and multi-language support.
","Neue Haas Unica is a revival of the neo-grotesque Unica. Unica was designed by Team ’77 (André Gürtler, Christian Mengelt and Erich Gschwind) and released in 1980. It was intended to be a hybrid of Helvetica, Univers and Akzidenz Grotesk - hence the name. Unica was released for a new format, phototypesetting, which quickly became obsolete and was then tied up in a legal dispute which prevented it making the transition to digital typesetting. It was finally recreated by for Monotype by Toshi Omagari.","Unica is a no-nonsense neo-grotesque with even fewer frills and ornaments than Helvetica and Neue Haas Grotesk. It also has more generous spacing than earlier grotesques and easier to read for long-form copy. If you are looking for a design-forward alternative to Helvetica where its austere tone is suitable, Neue Haas Unica is a great choice. However, if you are looking for a practical sans for UI labels and form components, Unica might not be the best choice.","Unica was designed to be different - sharper than Helvetica, warmer than Univers, cleaner than Akzidenz.",https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/neue-haas-unica,Meta;Franklin;DIN;Neuzeit;,Inter,fyj5txg,,,,10,,,,17,,17,10,9,10,15,132,1980,Neutral,ArtReview;Design Observer;Bella Union,

In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day. Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became fashionable to print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms. This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it takes influence from the designs of John Baskerville and from ‘Scotch Roman’ designs.<br/>This typeface was initially published in 2011, and had a major update in 2017. Being a Display (large size) design in the transitional genre, functionally and stylistically it can accompany Georgia or Gelasio for body text. It was succeeded in 2023 by the complete Playfair design, which as a variable font includes body text designs in the optical size axis.<br/>This is the main family, with a sibling Playfair Display SC small caps family. The main family downloaded font files include a full set of small caps, common ligatures, and discretionary ligatures.<br/>The Playfair project is led by Claus Eggers Sørensen, a type designer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. To contribute, see github.com/clauseggers/Playfair-Display
Playfair is well suited for general purpose typesetting. Playfair can be interpolated in three dimensions: Width, Weight and Optical Size. <br/>The optical size axis is the most extreme of the axes. Along that axis you can seamlessly change the letterforms from the extremely small Agate (5pt) to the extremely big Needlepoint (1200pt). The Agate has a very low contrast between the thickest and thinnest parts of its strokes, in fact the contrast is even slightly negative, meaning the the horisontal strokes are heavier than the vertical strokes. At the other end the Needlepoint is as high contrast as practically possible. The thinnest strokes are but a single unit wide, meaning that if you were to typeset in 1000 points using a Needlepoint weight, the resulting thinnest strokes would be one point wide. The weight axis adds a second dimension by allowing you to seamlessly change from a light regular to a dark black. <br/>An update in June 2023 slightly modifies the width axis, giving the text a narrower appearance. <br/>To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Playfair.","An open source serif that sits somewhere between a transitional and a modern.

Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more constructed and rationalist than is typical. The Devanagari design was particularly novel when it was first published in 2015, and was the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of weights in this genre. Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly circles.
Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary to maintain an even typographic color. The Devanagari base character height and the Latin ascender height are equal; Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari characters, and the Latin x-height is set rather high.
The project was developed by Indian Type Foundry (ITF). The Devanagari was initially designed by Ninad Kale, while the Latin was initially designed by Jonny Pinhorn. Following their principal phase of designing the first 5 styles, the typeface was later refined, and expanded to include multiple weights and italics, by the ITF studio team.

The close companionship of Serif and Sans is achieved by a careful match of letter proportions and typographic color. Source Serif is loosely based on the work of Pierre Simon Fournier, and many idiosyncrasies typical to Fournier’s designs (like the bottom serif on the b or the middle serif on the w) are also found in Source Serif. Without being a pure historical revival, Source Serif takes cues from Fournier and reworks them for a modern age. <br/>Both typeface families have different personalities because they spring from the hands of different designers: Source Serif was designed by Frank Grießhammer, Source Sans was designed by Paul Hunt. Robert Slimbach consulted on both designs, which helped maintain the overall family harmony. Either design feels confident on its own but also works in combination with the other — just like their designers do. <br/>Source Serif continues Adobe’s line of high-quality open source typefaces. Designed for a digital environment, the letter shapes are simplified and highly readable. Its historical roots, combined with expert guidance give the typeface a strong character of its own that will shine when used for extended text on paper or screen. <br/>Source Serif is an active Open Source project – if you are interested in contributing, please visit source-serif-pro on Github for more information.","A transitional serif designed by Adobe, distributed as an open source project by Google.
