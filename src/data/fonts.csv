Caslon’s types were based on seventeenth-century Dutch old style designs, which were then used extensively in England. Because of their remarkable practicality, Caslon’s designs met with instant success. Caslon’s types became popular throughout Europe and the American colonies; printer Benjamin Franklin hardly used any other typeface. The first printings of the American Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were set in Caslon. For her Caslon revival, designer Carol Twombly studied specimen pages printed by William Caslon between 1734 and 1770.

Adobe type designer Robert Slimbach has captured the beauty and balance of the original Garamond typefaces while creating a typeface family that offers all the advantages of a contemporary digital type family.

It is a community project to create a revival of Claude Garamont’s famous humanist typefaces from the mid-16th century. This digital version reproduces the original design by Claude Garamont closely: The source for the letterforms is a scan of a specimen known as the “Berner specimen,” which was composed in 1592 by Conrad Berner, the son-in-law of Christian Egenolff and his successor at the Egenolff print office. This specimen shows Garamont’s roman and Granjon’s italic types at different sizes. Hence the name of this project: Egenolff-Berner Garamond.   Why another Garamond? That typeface is a key moment in the history of typography, and European type designers have been reacting to this work ever since. It is probably the most revived typeface in the world and many are excellent. In the world of free/libre culture, however, only a few Garamond-inspired types exist, and none share the scope of this project.   In November 2019, the family has been updated to a variable font family.   This project is led by Georg Duffner, and developed at github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond",https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond,"A very high quality free Garamond. Has slightly different proportions to other Garamonds so looks slightly different at smaller sizes.

In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day. Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became fashionable to print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms. This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it takes influence from the designs of John Baskerville and from ‘Scotch Roman’ designs.<br/>This typeface was initially published in 2011, and had a major update in 2017. Being a Display (large size) design in the transitional genre, functionally and stylistically it can accompany Georgia or Gelasio for body text. It was succeeded in 2023 by the complete Playfair design, which as a variable font includes body text designs in the optical size axis.<br/>This is the main family, with a sibling Playfair Display SC small caps family. The main family downloaded font files include a full set of small caps, common ligatures, and discretionary ligatures.<br/>The Playfair project is led by Claus Eggers Sørensen, a type designer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. To contribute, see github.com/clauseggers/Playfair-Display
Playfair is well suited for general purpose typesetting. Playfair can be interpolated in three dimensions: Width, Weight and Optical Size. <br/>The optical size axis is the most extreme of the axes. Along that axis you can seamlessly change the letterforms from the extremely small Agate (5pt) to the extremely big Needlepoint (1200pt). The Agate has a very low contrast between the thickest and thinnest parts of its strokes, in fact the contrast is even slightly negative, meaning the the horisontal strokes are heavier than the vertical strokes. At the other end the Needlepoint is as high contrast as practically possible. The thinnest strokes are but a single unit wide, meaning that if you were to typeset in 1000 points using a Needlepoint weight, the resulting thinnest strokes would be one point wide. The weight axis adds a second dimension by allowing you to seamlessly change from a light regular to a dark black. <br/>An update in June 2023 slightly modifies the width axis, giving the text a narrower appearance. <br/>To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Playfair.",https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display,"An open source serif that sits somewhere between a transitional and a modern. More geometric than Baskerville, more playful than Century Schoolbook, it comes in a range of optical sizes that make it suitable for a range of applications from large titles to longform copy.
